## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn
- Python 3.8+
- API keys for:
  - OpenAI
  - ElevenLabs
  - NewsAPI (optional)
  - Supabase project

### Setting Up Supabase
1. Create a Supabase project at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Set up the database schema and policies by running the following SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create the podcasts table with correct data types
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.podcasts (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL, -- Using TEXT for compatibility with auth providers
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'processing' CHECK (status IN ('processing', 'completed', 'failed')),
  duration INTEGER NOT NULL,
  url TEXT,
  topics TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  host_voice TEXT NOT NULL,
  co_host_voice TEXT NOT NULL,
  language TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB,
  transcript TEXT,
  message TEXT
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE podcasts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy that allows users to view their own podcasts
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own podcasts" 
ON podcasts FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id);

-- Create policy that allows users to create their own podcasts
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own podcasts" 
ON podcasts FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = user_id);

-- Create policy that allows users to update their own podcasts
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own podcasts" 
ON podcasts FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id);

-- Optional: For development/testing only - allows service role to access all records
-- Remove this in production!
CREATE POLICY "Service role access to all podcasts" 
ON podcasts 
USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Add table comment
COMMENT ON TABLE podcasts IS 'Table for storing podcast information with RLS policies for user data protection';
```

3. Save your Supabase URL and anon key in your environment variables (needed for both frontend and backend)

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd Frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file with your environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd Backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv backend_venv
source backend_venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: backend_venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file with your API credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start the server
python main.py
```

## 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

1. **API Layer** (`/api/`):
   - REST endpoints for podcast generation and retrieval
   - Request validation and error handling
   - Authentication and authorization

2. **Core Services** (`/src/`):
   - `news_collector.py`: Gathers and filters news articles
   - `content_processor.py`: Transforms news into podcast scripts
   - `chat.py`: Manages conversational models
   - `audio.py`: Handles text-to-speech and audio processing

3. **Integration Points**:
   - OpenAI API for content processing
   - ElevenLabs API for voice synthesis
   - Supabase for data persistence
   - NewsAPI for article collection

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend implements a component-based architecture:

1. **Page Components**:
   - `CreatePodcastPage.tsx`: Interface for podcast generation
   - `PodcastDetailsPage.tsx`: Displays podcast information and player
   - `PodcastListPage.tsx`: Shows all user-generated podcasts

2. **Core Components**:
   - `AudioPlayer.tsx`: Custom audio player with controls
   - `VoiceSelector.tsx`: Interface for voice selection with previews
   - `PodcastProgressBar.tsx`: Real-time generation progress tracking

3. **Service Layer**:
   - API abstraction for backend communication
   - Authentication and user management
   - Error handling and state persistence

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for user sessions
- **API Security**: Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Error Handling**: Proper error boundaries and fallbacks
- **Environment Isolation**: Separation of development and production environments

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background tasks for long-running operations
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached to improve response times
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and resources are loaded only when needed
- **Resource Management**: Efficient handling of API requests and responses
- **Build Optimization**: Production builds are minified and optimized

## 🧩 Integration Options

- **Content Management Systems**: Integrate with CMS for managed content sources
- **Publishing Platforms**: Automatically distribute to podcast platforms
- **Analytics Tools**: Track listening statistics and engagement
- **Social Media**: Share generated podcasts across platforms
- **Custom Websites**: Embed players on any website
